# GA-Implementation
This is an implementation of Differential Evolution (DE) and improved Cross Entropy Method (CEM) to optimize loss functions 

## Loss functions 
Ackley, Michalewiz, Rosenbrock, Sphere, Zakharov are being used as benchmark functions to test out how efficient each approach is.

## Demonstration 
Using CEM (2 dimensions) to find the optima of the sphere function
